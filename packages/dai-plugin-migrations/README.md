## Contract naming convention

Contract names in `contracts/abis/addresses` are suffixed with a number (e.g.
`_1`) to indicate the **version** of the contract. The version can come from
either different deployments of the entire system (such as what might happen
after a global settlement), or a simple upgrade (as what happened when DsChief
was migrated when a vulnerability was found).

The numbering is totally arbitrary and chosen when we choose to support a new
contract. In the future, they could be renamed more descriptively.
